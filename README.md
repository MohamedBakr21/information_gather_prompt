# information_gather_prompt

This project demonstrates how to build a conversational chatbot using LangGraph and LangChain that collects user requirements for a prompt template and generates/refines it accordingly.

The chatbot operates in two main states:

Information Gathering: Collects details like the objective, input variables, constraints, and requirements.
Prompt Generation: Uses the gathered information to create a well-structured prompt template.
